As we move from Phabricator to using Pull Requests we will introduce a branch naming policy. This is to help prevent the number and names of branches becoming out of control. Branches will be easier to identify, organize and clean up.

Policy
Please begin all branch names with either feature or bug followed by a slash and then your ticket or any other branch name details.

feature/

bug/

For example fixing a bug could include the Jira ticket number and a description but must begin with ‘bug/.’ As example:

git checkout -b bug/NEX-4539-FixGitHookScript
